Web Service:
-----------
It is a client-server application.
WebService is a method of communication between the different servers over network.
It is a language independent way of communication.

Types of WebServices:
---------------------
1.SOAP
2.RESTFul
	---- It Stands for Represnetational State Transfer.
	---- It is an architectural style not a protocol.
	Advantages:
	----------
	1. Fast in executing the services.
	2. Consume less bandwidth and resources.
	3. Language and platform independent.
	4. Permits different Data types like Plain text, XML, HTML and JSON.
	5. Can use a SOAP as the implementation.

Features of WebServices
------------------------
1.XML Based language
2.Loosely Coupled.
3.Synchronous and Asynchronous
4.RPC.
5.Document Exchange.

Three Major Web Services components:
1.SOAP
		--- (Simple Object Access protocol)
		--- it is XML based protocol for accessing web services
		--- W3c recommended to use for communication between applications.
		--- It is platform Independent and Language independent.

		Advantages:
		-----------
		1. WS security: It contains the own security.(WS Security)
		2. Language and platform Independent: Can be written in any language and can execute in any language.
		Dis Advantages:
		---------------
		1. Slow: SOAP uses XML that must be parsed to read. So it is slow and consumes more bandwidth and resource.
		2. WSDL Dependent: SOAP uses WSDL and doesn't have any other mechanism to perform.

2.WSDL(Wiz-dull)
		--- Web Services Description Language.
		--- It is a XML document. It contains the information about methods, parameters and how to access it.
		--- It is the part of UDDI. It acts as interface between two web service applications.
3.UDDI
		--- Universal Description, Discovery and Integration.
		--- It is a XML based framework for describing, discovering and integrating web services.
		--- It is a directory of web service interfaces described by WSDL, containing information about the web services.
		
SOA (Service Oriented Architecture)
-----------------------------------
Service oriented Architecture is a design pattern. It is designed to build distributed systems that deliver services to other applications through protocol.

What is a service?
------------------
Service is a well defined, self contained function that represents a unit functionality. A Service can exchange information from other service.
It is not dependent on the state of service. It uses loosely coupled and message based communication model between applications.

For Example
-----------
Service consumer sends the service request to the Service provider.
Service provider sends the service response to the service consumer. 

Service Oriented Terminologies:
------------------------------
1. Services: The services are logical entities that defined by the different interfaces. 
2. Service provider: It is a software entity that implements the service specification.
3. Service Consumer: It can be called as Service requestor or client that request for service provider. It can be another service or end-user application.
4. Service Locator: It is a service provider that acts as a registry. It is responsible for examining the service provider interfaces and service locations.
5. Service Broker: It is a service provider that sends the request to different service providers.



Java Web Services Tutorials:
-----------------------------
This application perform communication through WSDL. There are two ways to write java web service application code: SOAP and RESTFul.

Java WebServices API:
---------------------
JAX-WS: This is for SOAP. This can be written in two ways by RPC Style and Document Style.
JAX-RS: This is for RESTFul. This can be written in two ways by Jersey and RESTEasy.

Difference b/w RPC Style and Document Style:
--------------------------------------------
1. RPC style uses method names and parameters to generate XML.   
2. SOAP message sent as many elements									  | SOAP message is sent as single document.
3. It is tightly coupled.                                                 | In document style, it is loosely coupled.
4. It is difficult to validated against schema.                           | In document style, can be validated against Schema
5. Parameters are sent as discrete values.                                | In document style, parameters are sent in XML
